**10. RISKS**

* 10.1.By accessing or using the Services , you understand and agree to the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks; Digital Assets, including the usage and intricacies of native Digital Assets, like ether (ETH); smart contract-based tokens, including fungible tokens and NFTs; and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. edgeX does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, including the Ethereum blockchain, is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (a) that edgeX is not responsible for the operation of the blockchain-based software and networks underlying the Services, (b) that there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (c) that the underlying blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” which may materially affect the Services. Blockchain networks use public and private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to Digital Assets on the Ethereum blockchain or other blockchain-based networks. Neither edgeX nor any other person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your Digital Assets. If your private key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to transfer your Digital Assets to any other blockchain address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value or utility from the Digital Assets that you may hold.
* 10.2.You acknowledge and understand that the Services and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of edgeX to continue to make available our proprietary software and could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services.
* 10.3.You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and the Services, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. To the extent possible, the smart contracts available on the Interface will be updated to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Services.
* 10.4.You understand that the Ethereum blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Ethereum blockchain is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services.
* 10.5.You acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided relating to the Services. This warning and other warnings that edgeX provides in these Terms are in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Services.

* 10.7.Any use or interaction with the Services requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science to appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.
* 10.8.Use of the Services in particular for entering into Perpetual Contracts may carry financial risk. Digital Assets, especially in connection with Perpetual Contracts, are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets, especially entering into Perpetual Contracts, can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets, including Perpetual Contracts. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you.

You acknowledge that these risks may have a material impact on your transactions using the Services, which may result in, among other things, failing to fulfill transactions at your desired price or at all.

Without limitation of any provision of these Terms, in the event that edgeX or any related party is found liable under these Terms, the aggregate liability of edgeX (together with our equity owners, members, directors, managers, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, or contractors), arising out of or in connection with your use of the Services (and any of their content and functionality), any performance or nonperformance of the Services, your Digital Assets, Perpetual Contracts or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of edgeX, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability or other theory of liability, will not exceed the amount of fees paid by you to edgeX under these Terms, if any, in the two (2) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.

**15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION**

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST edgeX IN ANY COURT OR GOVERNING AUTHORITY. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED BELOW, THIS SECTION REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR DISAGREEMENT (EACH A “DISPUTE”) ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE THAT AROSE BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATES OF THESE TERMS, TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS SECTION EXTENDS TO DISPUTES THAT AROSE OR INVOLVE FACTS OCCURING BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF THIS OR ANY PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE TERMS AS WELL AS DISPUTES THAT MAY ARISE AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE TERMS.

You and edgeX agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and edgeX and that any Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding. Nothing in this Section precludes you or edgeX from bringing an individual action for damages in a small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court, or from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in court for infringement or other alleged misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). Except as specified above, you and edgeX waive your rights to a judge or jury trial or to have any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against edgeX or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact edgeX and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to edgeX by email at legal@edgeX.exchange. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and edgeX cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California, under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. You and edgeX agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 15 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. The arbitrator, edgeX, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including all information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. You and edgeX agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and all other JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by edgeX, edgeX will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and edgeX agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award. Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and edgeX will not have the right to assert the claim. If any portion of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 15 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 15; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 15 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, then that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 15 will be enforceable.

**16. GOVERNING LAW**

The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any Dispute related to these Terms or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced under the laws of the State of California, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. For any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.
