# Deposits

**Ethereum Deposits:**

Users can deposit funds into their accounts by sending a transaction to the Ethereum mainnet after connecting their wallets to edgeX. Users can deposit USDT or a variety of other assets, which are then converted to USDT via 1inch's API for on-chain liquidity.

After the deposit transaction is mined, it typically requires approximately 15 confirmations (around 5 minutes) on the Ethereum network for the funds to become available for trading on edgeX.



**Non-Ethereum Deposits:**

edgeX has built multiple asset pools on different chains. When users deposit assets from a non-Ethereum chain, edgeX transfers an equivalent amount of assets to the user's L2 account through the corresponding asset pool on the respective chain.&#x20;

For USDT deposits from a non-Ethereum chain, edgeX transfers the equivalent amount to the user's L2 account through its asset pool.&#x20;

\*Kindly note that Ethereum deposits are processed instantly, regardless of the amount. However, for large one-time deposits (over $300K) on non-Ethereum chains, fund rebalancing between L1 and L2 may take up to 2 hours before the deposit is viewable on edgeX.



**Deposit Fees:**

Users are only responsible for the gas fees associated with the corresponding blockchain when making a deposit. Our platform does not charge any deposit fees.
