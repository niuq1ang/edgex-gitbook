# About edgeX

**edgeX** is an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain designed to deliver a high-performance on-chain trading infrastructure and a unified interface for DeFi.

**High-Performance Trading Infrastructure and Modules**&#x20;

edgeX is evolving from its perp app rollup (V1) into a high-performance financial chain (V2) that offers enhanced customizability and composability. This infrastructure will support the permissionless launch of various markets and DeFi products, utilizing a Proof of Demand mechanism backed by decentralized governance and edgeX’s ready-to-deploy trading modules.

**Settlement Layer (Self-Custody & Maximum Security)**&#x20;

edgeX settles all transaction volume on-chain, leveraging the security benefits of Ethereum L2 to ensure that transaction data is publicly verifiable and tamper-resistant. Typically, storing large amounts of transaction data on L1 incurs significant costs. However, by batching transactions into compact sets—while preserving their integrity—edgeX reduces on-chain fees to a minimal level. Harnessing the security of Ethereum L1, edgeX users’ assets are settled on Ethereum, ensuring self-custody. Only users themselves can access their assets with their own private keys.

**Match Engine Layer (High-Performance Trading Infrastructure & Features)**&#x20;

The edgeX Order Book—a high-throughput trading engine—has the capacity to process more than 20,000 of orders per second (TPS) with less than 10 ms of matching latency, setting a new benchmark among DEXs. Additionally, edgeX has pioneered advanced trading features such as trailing TP/SL, 100x leverage, and CEX-level risk limits to deliver a superior trading experience. In addition to perp trading, edgeX’s spot and AMM vault products are in development and are expected to launch in about a month.

**Hybrid Liquidity Layer (Access Multi-chain Liquidity While Retaining Self-custody)**&#x20;

edgeX employs cross-chain messaging to facilitate interoperability between edgeX chain and any other chain, allowing users to seamlessly deposit and withdraw assets on whichever network they prefer. In addition, edgeX maintains canonical bridges to enable transfers of native assets. Regardless of the method users choose, they retain full self-custody of their assets.

By integrating seamlessly with liquidity flows across the EVM ecosystem and beyond, edgeX’s products and modules can be deployed to interact with Solidity contracts written for Ethereum Mainnet and other L2s. edgeX also integrates trading-bot functionality (via edgeX.fun) and will launch multi-chain spot trading in the coming month—enabling traders to access trending data and analysis quickly and intelligently, capturing alpha opportunities across more than 70 blockchains.

**edgeX UI (A Unified DeFi Interface)**&#x20;

edgeX aims to serve as a bridge for CEX retail users to enter the DeFi space, simplifying multi-chain and multi-protocol complexities into one unified, feature-rich trading interface. In particular, the mobile interfaces (iOS and Android) are designed for retail users, incorporating smooth onboarding features such as MPC-based social logins and cross-chain deposits and withdrawals—delivering a CEX-like user experience.
