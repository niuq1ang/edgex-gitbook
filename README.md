**High-Performance Trading Infrastructure and Modules**&#x20;

edgeX is evolving from its current Perp app rrollup into a high-performance financial chain that offers enhanced customizability and composability. This infrastructure will support the permissionless launch of various markets and DeFi products, utilizing a Proof of Demand mechanism backed by decentralized governance and edgeX’s ready-to-deploy trading modules.



**Cross-Platform, Retail-Centric DeFi Interface**&#x20;

edgeX begins with an MVP launch—a high-performance Perp DEX featuring best-in-class, customized app interfaces (Web, iOS, and Android) designed for retail users. The app aims to serve as a bridge for CEX retail users to enter the DeFi space, simplifying multi-chain and multi-protocol complexities into one unified, feature-rich trading interface.



**Features:**

**Self-Custody & Security:** Harnessing the security of Ethereum L1, edgeX users’ assets are settled and self-custodied on Ethereum. Only users themselves can access their assets with their own private keys.

**Performance-Centric Modules:** edgeX’s Order Book, a high-performance trading engine module, can handle millions of order operations with a 10ms matching latency. Additional ready-to-deploy modules are in development and will be gradually opened to the developer community.

**EVM Compatibility & Interoperability:** edgeX is committed to scaling Ethereum with a focus on performance and accessibility. By integrating seamlessly with liquidity flows across the ecosystem and beyond, edgeX’s products and modules can be deployed to interact with Solidity contracts written for Ethereum Mainnet and other L2s.

**Abstracted UX & Low Fees:** By leveraging the scalability of L2, edgeX maximally abstracts multi-protocol complexities and costs for users, offering a unified on-chain experience.
